h1. Spree Mp3player

This is a spree extension that will allow you to upload (several) mp3s to a product. These will be shown as neat flash players in the product details.





h2. Installation

I assume that you already have a Rails 3 Spree application up and running. If not, the "Spree Documentation":http://spreecommerce.com/documentation will help you getting started.

To make use of @digital_spree@, you need to add this line to your @Gemfile@:

<pre>
  gem 'spree_mp3player', :git => 'git://github.com/funkensturm/spree_mp3player.git', :branch => 'master'
</pre>

The following terminal commands will copy the file "spree_mp3player/db/migration/20110410134727_create_mp3s.rb":http://github.com/funkensturm/spree_mp3player/blob/master/db/migrate/20110410134727_create_digitals.rb to the corresponding directory in your Rails application and apply the migration to your database. Also the Flash player will be copied into your public folder at /rails_root/public/swf/dewplayer-mini.swf

<pre>
  rake spree_mp3player:install
  rake db:migrate
</pre>
